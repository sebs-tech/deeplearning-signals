# Keras optimizers comparison and training analysis

## Definition 
In Keras, an open-source neural network library written in Python, optimizers are algorithms or methods used to adjust the weights of a neural network during training to minimize the loss function. Essentially, they help in finding the best parameters for the model to make accurate predictions.

1. **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: The simplest form of optimization algorithm. It updates the weights using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights, often with a small learning rate. Variants include momentum and Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG).
2. **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**: Combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent. It computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter and uses momentum-like terms.
3. **RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation)**: Adjusts the learning rate for each weight based on the average of recent gradients for that weight. It is particularly useful for handling non-stationary objectives.
4. **Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm)**: Adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the frequency of updates. It tends to perform well for sparse data.
5. **Adadelta**: An extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate. It uses a window of accumulated past gradients to normalize the gradients.
6. **FTRL (Follow The Regularized Leader)**: An optimization algorithm that incorporates regularization into the learning process. It is useful in scenarios where data is sparse and there are many features.

## Why use Optimizers?
Using Keras optimizers is essential for training neural networks effectively and efficiently:

1. **Parameter Adjustment**: Optimizers update the weights of the neural network based on the gradients computed during backpropagation. Without these adjustments, the model would not learn or improve its predictions.
2. **Convergence**: Optimizers help in converging the model to a solution that minimizes the loss function. Different optimizers have varying strategies for adjusting the learning rates and updating weights, which can impact how quickly and effectively the model reaches a good solution.
3. **Learning Rate Management**: Many optimizers, like Adam and RMSprop, adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter. This can lead to faster convergence and better performance compared to using a fixed learning rate.
4. **Handling Large Datasets**: Optimizers like SGD and its variants (e.g., Mini-batch SGD) are designed to handle large datasets efficiently. They perform updates based on a subset of the data, which can be more computationally feasible than using the entire dataset at once.
5. **Escaping Local Minima**: Advanced optimizers (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) can help in escaping local minima or saddle points in the loss landscape, leading to better overall performance and more robust models.
6. **Momentum and Acceleration**: Some optimizers incorporate techniques like momentum (e.g., SGD with momentum) or adaptive moment estimation (e.g., Adam) to accelerate learning and smooth out the training process, which can lead to faster and more stable convergence.
7. **Regularization**: Some optimizers (e.g., Adagrad, Adadelta) incorporate forms of regularization, either explicitly or implicitly, to improve generalization and avoid overfitting.
8. **Ease of Use**: Keras provides a high-level API for optimizers, making it easy to experiment with different optimization algorithms without needing to implement them from scratch. This simplifies the process of training models and tuning their performance.


Choosing the right optimizer and tuning its hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance and efficiency of your neural network. Keras optimizers offer a range of options, allowing you to select the most appropriate one based on your specific problem and data.
